This is example code for having a c library execute a java method as a callback.


com.yahoo.jni.example.ExampleJni  This class calls the JNI and gives it a Java function to use as a callback

com.yahoo.jni.example.JniLibraryLoader  This class is because I'm sick of wondering why someone can't load the .so

com.yahoo.jni.example.RunCallback Is the main class.  java -cp target/class -Djava.library.path=target/native/x86_64-darwin-clang com.yahoo.jni.example.RunCallback

com.yahoo.jni.example.ExampleJniAccess  This is the class containing the native functions

com.yahoo.jni.example.CallbackImplementation This class contains the java function that the c library will call in the end.

calback_support.cpp: This file contains the functions that help find and attach the jvm.  Currently assumes no other threads are in play.

callbacklib.cpp/h:  This is the "library" in our simple case it's a single function call: magicCFunction.

com_yahoo_jni_example_ExampleJniAccess.cpp  This is the c behind ExampleJniAccess.  This binds the java to the c.
com_yahoo_jni_example_ExampleJniAccess.h  autogenerated with javah -cp target/classes com.yahoo.jni.example.ExampleJniAccess   I typically copy this to start the cpp file.

jni_helper_defines.h  This is a set of macros you'll also find here: https://github.com/yahoo/mdbm/blob/master/src/java/jni_helper_defines.h  these originated in as swig helper macros, and have since
become useful outside of that.
